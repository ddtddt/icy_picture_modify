2.4.0 2013-08-13

  - Accept group name when specifing values for `_of` variables (they are
    `edit_image_of`, `replace_image_of`, `delete_image_of`). This is bc.
    there are no difference between a `group` and a `user` (which is
    considered as a group that has only one member.)

2.3.1 2013-03-16

  - Add a workaround to support Piwigo 2.5. The default template of Piwigo
    doesn't contain `U_ADMIN` hence we have to add some specific HTML code
    (to template) from the main code without translation support.

2.3.0 2012-11-15

  - Add guest support (Allow guest to edit, upload images). This feature
    is disabled by default. Example is in `doc/*.sample_allow_guest`
