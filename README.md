# NAME

  `icy_picture_modify` -- Allow user to modify any pictures

# DESCRIPTION

  A piwigo extension that allows users to edit any set of images.
  This extension just works as the `picture_modify.php` for administrator.

  The code of this plugin is based on the original source
  `picture_modify.php` of the Piwigo distribution (version 2.2.3.)

  Advanced ACL is supported since version 1.2.0.

# FEATURES

  Normal users in Piwigo system can delete image or modify image's metadata
  (author, date, tags, description, metada, linking/represented categories).
  They can upload some images to some categories.

  Advanced ACL allow users to work with any set of images / categories.

# USAGE

  * Install and enable this plugin and the plugin `community`.

  * Create and edit ACL file in `local/config/icy_acl.zml` in your Piwigo
    installation. A sample file can be found in `doc/icy_acl.zml.sample`.
    You don't have to modify any settings for the plugin `community`.
    Moverover, any settings of the plugin `community` will be ignored.

  * If you are using a development of the plugin, please clean up the
    obsolete files (See `OBSOLETE FILES` below.)

# OBSOLETE FILES

  The following files are obsolsete. They need to be ported to new format
  and/or to be removed

  * `local/config/icy_acl.php`:
    need to be ported to `local/config/icy_acl.zml`. After your old ACL
    settings are ported to new format, you can safely delete this file;

  * `_data/icy.log`:
    if you are using `icy_picture_modify` version 2.0.0 or higher, you
    can safely remove this file.

# KNOWN PROBLEMS

  * No webUI for ACL editting

  * If an image is replaced by other version (using plugin `Photo update`)
    the author of (new) image will be owned by administrator, not the
    current user. Hence the image won't be editable anymore.

  * This plugin doesn't support all known templates

  * This plugin may not work smoothly without the plugin 'community'

  * User can delete an image which is associated to some albums to which
    the user doesn't have permission to write/access. This is true as the
    plugin only checks owner of the image.

# SUPPORT

  To get support, please create new issue at

# DEVELOPMENT

  The plugin requires a webUI for ACL editting. Unfortunately, the author
  isn't good at template system used by Piwigo. Feel free to help us to
  write a webUI :)
