NAME

  icy_picture_modify -- Allow user to modify their pictures

DESCRIPTION

  A piwigo extension that allows users to modify pictures they uploaded.
  This extension just works as the 'picture_modify.php' for administrator.

  The code of this plugin is heavily based on the original source
  'picture_modify.php' of the Piwigo distribution (version 2.2.3.)

USAGE

  1. Install and enable the plugin "community" which allows users to
     upload pictures to some albums. Please configure the plugin before
     you install "icy_picture_modify".

  2. Install and enable this plugin

  3. When users view a picture they uploaded, they will be provided a link
     to modify that picture's information.

FEATURES

  Users can delete image or modify image's properties (author, date, tags,
  description, metada, associcate/aissociated/represented categories).

KNOWN PROBLEMS

  * If an image is replaced by other version (using plugin 'Photo update')
    the author of (new) image will be owned by administrator, not the
    current user. Hence the image won't be editable anymore

  * This plugin doesn't support all known templates

  * This plugin may not work smoothly without the plugin 'community'

  * User can delete an image which is associated to some albums to which
    the user doesn't have permission to write/access. This is true as the
    plugin only checks owner of the image.
