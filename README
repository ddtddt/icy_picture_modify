NAME

  icy_picture_modify -- Allow user to modify any pictures

DESCRIPTION

  A piwigo extension that allows users to edit any set of images.
  This extension just works as the 'picture_modify.php' for administrator.

  The code of this plugin is heavily based on the original source
  'picture_modify.php' of the Piwigo distribution (version 2.2.3.)

  Advanced ACL is supported since version 1.2.0.

USAGE

  1. Install and enable this plugin

  2. Install and enable the plugin "community" which allows
     users to upload pictures to some albums.

  3. When users view a picture they uploaded, they will be provided a link
     to modify that picture's information.

FEATURES

  Users can delete image or modify image's properties (author, date, tags,
  description, metada, associcate/aissociated/represented categories).

  Advanced ACL allow users to work with any set of images / categories.

WORKING WITH PLUGIN COMMUNITY

  TODO

KNOWN PROBLEMS

  * No webUI for ACL editting
  * If an image is replaced by other version (using plugin 'Photo update')
    the author of (new) image will be owned by administrator, not the
    current user. Hence the image won't be editable anymore

  * This plugin doesn't support all known templates

  * This plugin may not work smoothly without the plugin 'community'

  * User can delete an image which is associated to some albums to which
    the user doesn't have permission to write/access. This is true as the
    plugin only checks owner of the image.

SUPPORT

HELP WANTED

  The plugin requires a webUI for ACL editting. Unfortunately, the author
  isn't good at template system used by Piwigo. Feel free to help us to
  write a webUI :)
