NAME

  icy_picture_modify -- Allow user to modify any pictures

DESCRIPTION

  A piwigo extension that allows users to edit any set of images.
  This extension just works as the 'picture_modify.php' for administrator.

  The code of this plugin is heavily based on the original source
  'picture_modify.php' of the Piwigo distribution (version 2.2.3.)

  Advanced ACL is supported since version 1.2.0.

USAGE

  1. Install and enable this plugin

  2. (Optional) Install and enable the plugin "community" which allows
     users to upload pictures to some albums.

     This step is optional, but it may be very useful if you want to have
     a quick start: The plugin "community" has a good UI to control its
     behavior, but this plugin heavily depends on text-based configuration.

     Please see the section WORKING WITH PLUGIN COMMUNITY for details.

  3. Create and edit the file "local/config/icy_acl.php". A sample file
     can be found in the directory "doc" of the plugin.

  4. When user views an image which is editable by them, a link will
     be provided to user; following that link will bring user to special
     page in which user can enter new information for the image.

     The place of the depends on the theme' settings. You can see a demo
     in the screenshot "doc/icy_picture_modify_edit_link.jpg": it's the
     third icon next to the heart icon.

FEATURES

  Users can delete image or modify image's properties (author, date, tags,
  description, metada, associcate/aissociated/represented categories).

  Advanced ACL allow users to work with any set of images / categories.

WORKING WITH PLUGIN COMMUNITY

  Differences

    The plugin 'community' is very good, but its current version has some
    limitations:

    (1) There are only two cases
        - User can upload images to any categories in the gallery, or
        - User can only upload images to a gallery and its sub galleries.
    (2) Doesn't allow user to edit information of user' picture.

    The first versions of 'icy_picture_modify' solve the problem (2).
    Since version 1.2.0, the problem (1) is also resolved.

  Working together

    When both plugins are enabled, 'icy_picture_modify' will read list
    of categories to which user can uplaod images and append such list
    to settings in $ICY_ACL.

KNOWN PROBLEMS

  * No webUI for ACL editting
  * This plugin doesn't support all known templates
  * User can delete an image which is associated to some albums to which
    the user doesn't have permission to write/access. This is true as the
    plugin only checks owner of the image.

HELP WANTED

  The plugin requires a webUI for ACL editting. Unfortunately, the author
  isn't good at template system used by Piwigo. Feel free to help us to
  write a webUI :)
